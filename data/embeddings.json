Automated Police Referral System:- SHO, Circle Officers, and Special Units can digitally refer individuals for counselling, medical examination, or rehabilitation, ensuring transparent monitoring of each case. 3.

Subject: Request for Development of a \"Drug Abuse Rehabilitation Management Portal\u201d for Commissionerate, Jodhpur. Sir, The Commissionerate Jodhpur is consistently working towards strengthening technology-driven preventive policing mechanisms, particularly in the areas of drug abuse control, high-risk individual monitoring, and rehabilitation-based interventions. Drug addiction has emerged as a key factor contributing to repeat offences, disturbed law and order, and vulnerability among youth. At present, the monitoring and rehabilitation process is scattered across multiple agencies, making it difficult to track individuals, review progress, or ensure coordinated intervention. In view of this, the Commissionerate, Jodhpur proposes the development of an integrated digital platform titled \u201cDrug Abuse Rehabilitation Management Portal\u201d. This portal aims to streamline the entire cycle of identification, referral, counselling, rehabilitation, relapse prevention, and community-based monitoring of individuals involved in drug abuse or substance dependency. Proposed Key Features of the Portal:- Unified Digital Case Repository:- Comprehensive profiles of drug-dependent individuals, including personal details, medical history (as allowed), police inputs, referral records, counselling notes, and rehabilitation progress. 2. Automated Police Referral System:- SHO, Circle Officers, and Special Units can digitally refer individuals for counselling, medical examination, or rehabilitation, ensuring transparent monitoring of each case. 3. Al-Assisted Risk Categorization:- The system can use pattern-based analytics to categorise individuals into low, moderate, or high-risk groups based on behaviour, field intelligence, and previous relapse history. 4. Relapse Prediction & Alert Mechanism:- Based on field entries, counsellor feedback, and risk scores, the portal will generate automatic alerts for high-risk individuals likely to relapse. 5. Hotspot & Pattern Analysis Dashboard:- GlS-enabled mapping to identify drug hotspots, vulnerable areas, peddling patterns, and repeat offender clusters for strategic and targeted police action. 6. Integration with NGOs, Rehab Centres & Counsellors:- A dedicated interface for external stakeholders to update follow-up sessions, treatment progress, relapse notes, and case closure status. 7.
